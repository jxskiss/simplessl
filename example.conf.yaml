# Explanations

# listen: The address ssl-cert-server should listen, be sure DON'T open the server to the world.
# pid_file: The pid file path, it's used when doing graceful restarts.

# storage: Cache storage settings.
# storage.type: "dir_cache" or "redis"
# storage.dir_cache: If type is "dir_cache", which directory to store cached certificate files.
# storage.redis: If type is "redis", the settings of Redis.
# storage.redis.addr: The connection string of Redis.
# storage.redis.prefix: An optional string to use as prefix of certificate keys.

# managed: Managed certificates settings.
# managed.pattern: pattern to match domain names
# managed.cert_key: if pattern is matched, the key of the cache storage to load certificate from

# lets_encrypt: ACME Let's Encrypt settings.
# lets_encrypt.staging: Use Let's Encrypt staging directory (default false)
# lets_encrypt.force_rsa: Generate certificates with 2048-bit RSA keys (default false)
# lets_encrypt.renew-before: Renew certificates before how many days (default 30)
# lets_encrypt.email: ACME account contact email, if Let's Encrypt client's key is already registered, this is not used
# lets_encrypt.domains: Allowed domain names, match by check string equality
# lets_encrypt.re_patterns: Allowed domain name regex patterns

# self_signed: Self signed certificate settings.
# self_signed.enable: whether enable self-signed certificate (default false)
# self_signed.check_sni: whether check SNI name for self-signed certificate (default false)
# self_signed.valid_days: how may days to set the certificate when generating self-signed certificate
# self_signed.organization: organization to set the certificate when generating self-signed certificate
# self_signed.cert_key: the key to put generated self-signed certificate into cache storage
